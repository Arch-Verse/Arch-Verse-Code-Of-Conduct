# The Archverse Code of Conduct

By participating in the Archverse community, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and any future updates to it. We
reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. While we will strive to communicate significant changes, continued
participation in the community after changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.

Additionally, you agree to comply with [Discordâ€™s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community

removal from the community.

### Age Requirements

By joining, you confirm that you are old enough to use discord as per their terms of service. The minimum age is 13, but
it can be up to 16 in some places. You can find the official list
[here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday) Note that
having the minimum age requirement does not permit explicit or adult jokes given our diverse age group.

### Discrimination

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on a person's gender, sexuality, race, religion, ethnicity,
nationality, language, age, body size, and other aspects of their identity. Our community is inclusive, and any
discriminatory actions may result in moderation action.

### Appropriate content

Your content must remain appropriate for a community that includes minors, and adults. It cannot be sexually
explicit, and/or hateful towards individuals/groups that are generally considered to be not harmful for society.
Although you can have your own opinion about who's harmful or not, we will follow the widely accepted standards of
society to define what's harmful or not
