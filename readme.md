By participating in the Archverse community, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and any future updates to it. We
reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. While we will strive to communicate significant changes, continued
participation in the community after changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.

Additionally, you agree to comply with [Discordâ€™s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community

removal from the community.

### 1. Age Requirements

By joining, you confirm that you are old enough to use discord as per their terms of service. The minimum age is 13, but
it can be up to 16 in some places. You can find the official list
[here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday) Note that
having the minimum age requirement does not permit explicit or adult jokes given our diverse age group.

### 2. Discrimination

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on a person's:

- 1. Gender
- 2. Sexuality
- 3. Race
- 4. Religion
- 5. Ethnicity
- 6. Nationality
- 7. Language
- 8. Age
- 9. Body size
- 10. Disabilities
- 11. And other aspects of their identity.

Our community is inclusive, and any discriminatory actions may result in moderation action.

### 3. Appropriate content

Your content must remain appropriate for a community that includes minors, and adults. It cannot fall under:

- 1) Sexually explicit: For more info, you can check out [cornell law
  website](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256), or search up definitions online. But you may not argue
  about this in the server.

- 2) This is not a dating server. Do not hit on people (even accidentally). This server is open to minors, and we can't
  verify anyone's age, so we have to treat all instances as potential interaction with a minor, regardless of how old
  anyone says they are. As an adult, you don't want to get into these kind of stuff with a minor, as a minor, you don't
  want to get into these kind of stuff with an adult, and as a server, we don't want to see our members engaging in
  these kinds of behaviours.

- 3) Hateful towards individuals/groups that are generally considered to be not harmful for society. Although you can
     have your own opinion about who's harmful or not, we will follow the widely accepted standards of society to define
     what's harmful or not.

- 4) Spam in the general chats: A couple gifs and image macros here and there are fine, but don't flood the chat with
  memes and/or gifs. Do not post loud videos without a volume warnings, don't flood it with low effort troll garbage.
  Don't flood the chat period.

- 5) Piracy: Discussion on piracy is allowed, but do comply with the discord TOS, we do not give any permission to
  provide links and/or source and/or share screenshots with links to sources on pirated material.

- 6) Support Rules: Support is offered in public channels and is accessible to everyone. Trolling, being malicious,
  and/or shitposting in the support channels will revoke your access to them. Do **not** provide or ask for remote
  support via SSH or other protocols.

### Last words:

If you see any rule-breaking, please remember to open a ticket using the /tickets open command.
