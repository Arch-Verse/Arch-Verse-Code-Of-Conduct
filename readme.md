# The Archverse Code of Conduct

By participating in the Archverse community, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and any future updates to it. We
reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. While we will strive to communicate significant changes, continued
participation in the community after changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.

Additionally, you agree to comply with [Discordâ€™s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community
Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Violations of any of the above may result in suspension or permanent
removal from the community.

### Age Requirements

By joining, you confirm that you are old enough to use discord as per their terms of service. The minimum age is 13, but
it can be up to 16 in some places. You can find the official list
[here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday) Note that
having the minimum age requirement does not permit explicit or adult jokes given our diverse age group.

> 2) **Don't be a dick.** This means don't harass, discriminate, or be an asshole. If mods or any user asks you to stop doing something, you're making them uncomfortable and any reistance will make you liable for banning. This includes offensive language, trolling, flaming, hate speech, discrimination and bigotry of any kind. Don't tell people to rtfm or post malicious commands without explicitely stating it as a joke.

> 3) **No NSFW/NSFL.** Do NOT under any circumstance post nsfw or nsfw (gore/violence) of any kind in the server. This is also not a dating server, so do not hit on people (even accidentally). This server is open to minors, and we can't verify anyones age, so we have to treat all instances as potential interaction with a minor, regardless of how old you say you are.

> 4) **No spam.** A couple gifs and image macros here and there are fine, but don't flood the chat with memes or gifs. Do not post loud videos without a volume warnings, don't flood it with low effort troll arbage. Don't flood the chat period.

> 5) **Piracy.** Discussion on piracy is allowed, but do not provide links, or share screenshots with links to sources on pirated material.

> 6)  **Support Rules.** Support is offered in public channels and is accessible to everyone. Trolling, being malicious, or shitposting in the support channels will revoke your access to them. Do **not** provide or ask for remote support via SSH or other protocols.

Please read the [Arch Linux Code of Conduct](<https://terms.archlinux.org/docs/code-of-conduct/>) for further information.

Rules are subject to change at any time, and any decision made is final and up to moderator discretion.

If you see any rulebreaking, please remember to open a ticket using the /tickets open command.
